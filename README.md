# The Game

In the game, you will be able to do any of the actions as shown in "Image 4". The actions are described as below.

level has multiple stages where each stage has a number of enemies you will need to defeat in order to proceed and
eventually clear the levels and gain rewards.
* <b>MANAGE PLAYER BASE</b> -> build, level up, and remove buildings on your player base. Trees can be built for decorations;
obstacles can be removed; and buildings to strengthen legendary creatures (e.g., magic altar), produce resources
(e.g., gold mine and gem mine), increase legendary creatures' EXP (i.e., training area), and so forth can be built.
* <b>MANAGE BATTLE TEAM</b> -> add and remove legendary creatures from your team. By default, the first legendary creature
appearing in the order the legendary creatures were added is the team leader.
